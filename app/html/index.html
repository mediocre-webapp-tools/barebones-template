		BROWSERIFY SCRIPT BUNDLE TAG

		The line of code below this comment block will be replaced with a script tag
		including the browserify bundle containing every script. Do not modify it.

		Do not add any aditional scripts into this any file either, whether it's by
		linking a script from a CDN, or wraping your own script around <script> tags.
		Aditional scripts should be required inside main.js (using browserify-shim
		if they are not CommonJS modules), and scripts from CDNs should be loaded
		asynchronously (with script.js, for instance).
